## Inspiration

First and foremost, checkout [tranzuanthang's lrcget](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget) this was the main inspiration behind Lyric-Sync. If you're looking for an offline solution, then [lrcget](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget) is your answer.
[tranxuanthang](https://github.com/tranxuanthang) is also the individual behind [lrclib.net](https://lrclib.net/) which is currently the only lyric source that Lyric-Synce supports (more to come in the future)

## Installation

### Docker

Docker is the recommended way to run Lyric-Sync. It just makes things easier.

Lyric-Sync must have access to your Plex Music library and the root directory must be named exactly the same. If Plex says song2 is at path `/music/artist/song2.flac`, then Lyric-Sync should see it there as well, otherwise Lyric-Sync won't be able to find music where Plex is telling it to.

Here is a sample docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  lyric-sync:
    image: ghcr.io/phishbacon/lyric-sync:main
    container_name: lyric-sync
    environment:
      - ORIGIN=http://where-lyric-sync-is-running:3000
    volumes:
      - /your-music-library:/your-music-library
    ports:
      - "3000:3000" # lyric sync runs on port 3000
    restart: unless-stopped
```

`docker-compose up -d` and you're on your way.

Or the old fashioned way

```bash
# grab the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/phishbacon/lyric-sync:main

# and run
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ORIGIN=http://where-lyric-sync-is-running:3000 \
  --volume /your-music-library:/your-music-library \
  --name lyric-sync \
  -i ghcr.io/phishbacon/lyric-sync:main
```

### Building and Running Locally

You can also build Lyric-Sync yourself if you don't wish to run it in a container.

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:phishbacon/lyric-sync.git

# cd into the project directory
cd lyric-sync

# install dependencies
pnpm install

# copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env
cp .env.example .env

# build it
pnpm build

# start Lyric-Sync
node build
```

## Contributing

Lyric-Sync is an open source project, it is made possible with contributors like you.

The best way to start contributing to Lyric-Sync is by having access to an instance of Plex. This way, you can populate the database with real data and get real responses back from Plex.

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:phishbacon/lyric-sync.git

# cd into the project directory
cd lyric-sync

# install dependencies
pnpm install

# copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env
cp .env.example .env

# start the project
pnpm dev
```

## Developer Notes

Lyric-Sync is currently using [Skeleton v3 Beta](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/discussions/2919) one issue I have noticed is that when doing an each block with cards, the first one is always sized differently than the ones that follow. My current workaround is to just add a dummy entry to the array that is being iterated over. The dummy entry has a `hide_me` key on it so we can hide the offending card.

For the semantic release workflow to work, the branch must already exist on the remote, ie pushing to a non existent branch will result in the action failing.
